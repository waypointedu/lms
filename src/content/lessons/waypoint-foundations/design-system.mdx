## Objectives

- Apply Waypoint ink/cloud/accent tokens via Tailwind CSS v4.
- Build card, pill, and glass patterns used across the LMS shell.
- Align typography (Inter + Merriweather) with accessible contrast.

## Implementation notes

- Tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`; components rely on CSS variables for shadows, radii, and gradients.
- Shared layout pieces include `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, `SectionHeader`, and `CourseCard`.
- Keep assets text-based (SVG) to simplify Git diffs and deployments.
