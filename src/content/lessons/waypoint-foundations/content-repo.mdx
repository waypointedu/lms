title: "MDX content + GitHub previews"

## Objectives

- Author courses in Markdown/MDX stored directly in the repo.
- Use build-time loading to render content on the server for SEO and accessibility.
- Plan for a dedicated content repo pulled via Git submodule or GitHub API.

## Implementation notes

- Sample course files live in `src/content/courses` and lessons in `src/content/lessons`.
- `src/lib/markdown.ts` reads MDX by relative path and returns frontmatter + body.
- The course catalog and lesson routes load published courses from Supabase and render MDX content from the referenced path.
