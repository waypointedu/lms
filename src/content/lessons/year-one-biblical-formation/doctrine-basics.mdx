title: "Core doctrines for Year One"
---

This lesson summarizes the core doctrines you will reference during Year One:

- The Triune God: Father, Son, and Spirit at work from creation to new creation.
- The Church: a family of disciples sent into the world.
- Salvation and hope: the good news of Jesus, personal and communal.

Reflect on which doctrine feels most hopeful and which feels most challenging. Bring one question to office hours.
