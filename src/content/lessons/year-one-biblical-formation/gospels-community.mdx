title: "Reading the Gospels in community"
---

We learn Scripture in community. Practice:

1. Read a Gospel passage aloud twice. Listen for repeated words or surprising phrases.
2. Ask, “What does this show me about Jesus? About us?” Capture notes in your cohort thread.
3. Pray for one another using the passage as your guide.

**Checkpoint connection:** Use your notes when submitting the Week 1 reflection.
