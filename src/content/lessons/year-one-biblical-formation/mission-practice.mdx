title: "Everyday mission experiments"
---

Design a simple mission experiment for this week:

- Choose one act of hospitality or service you can do in 30–60 minutes.
- Invite someone from your cohort or community to join you.
- Afterward, record what surprised you and where you sensed God at work.

Log the experiment in your checkpoint submission so faculty can give feedback.
