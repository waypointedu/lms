title: "Living into the biblical story"
---

The biblical story begins with creation, moves through covenant, and centers on Jesus. In this lesson:

- Read Genesis 1–3 as a community, noting what it says about God, people, and vocation.
- Sketch the arc from creation to new creation and name where you see hope.
- Share a brief reflection (3–4 sentences) on how this week’s reading shapes your practice.

**Checkpoint connection:** Completing this lesson counts toward the Week 1 checkpoint.
