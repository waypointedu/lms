title: "Preparing for your capstone conversation"
---

Your capstone conversation is a guided dialogue with faculty. To prepare:

- Draft a 5-minute testimony that connects Scripture, doctrine, and your mission experiment.
- Gather one artifact: a journal page, photo, or note that captures your growth.
- Request three time windows for scheduling; be flexible across time zones.

When you click **Mark complete**, the dashboard will remind you to schedule the conversation.
