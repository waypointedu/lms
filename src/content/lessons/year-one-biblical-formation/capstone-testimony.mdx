title: "Sharing your story and testimony"
---

Use this outline when you share during the capstone conversation:

1. Where you started this year.
2. One Scripture that now anchors you.
3. A practice you will continue (prayer, Sabbath, hospitality, etc.).
4. How you hope to serve your community next.

Bring this outline and be ready for a short Q&A with your faculty reviewer.
