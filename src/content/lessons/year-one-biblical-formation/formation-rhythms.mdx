title: "Prayer, Sabbath, and community rhythms"
---

Practice a sustainable rhythm:

- **Daily:** A short prayer of gratitude and a petition for your community.
- **Weekly:** One Sabbath block with no work. Journal how it restores you.
- **Community:** Share a prayer request with your cohort and follow up in three days.

Submit a short note about what changed when you tried Sabbath this week.
