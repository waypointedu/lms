title: "Listening to culture with wisdom"
---

Mission begins with listening. This lab invites you to:

1. Ask a neighbor or friend where they find hope and meaning.
2. Listen without correcting; capture exact phrases.
3. Summarize what you heard and how it aligns or diverges from the biblical story.

Your summary feeds directly into the Week 8 culture listening checkpoint.
