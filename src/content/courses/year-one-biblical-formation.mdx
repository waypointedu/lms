Welcome to the Waypoint Learning Pathway. Year One moves through Scripture, doctrine, culture, and mission with a clear weekly rhythm:

- Read and discuss Scripture together.
- Practice prayer, Sabbath, and community rhythms.
- Listen to your neighborhood with humility.
- Share your story in a guided capstone conversation.

### What you will complete

1. Weekly checkpoints with simple submissions (reflections, voice notes, or links).
2. A mid-pathway “culture listening” lab with peer feedback.
3. A capstone conversation where you share your testimony and a plan for next steps.

### How to stay on track

- **Self-paced weeks:** Each checkpoint includes the readings and prompts you need.
- **Faculty support:** Faculty or reviewers join office hours and review your capstone.
- **Pathway-ready content:** Lessons live in MDX and stay synced with the repository; progress and reflections are stored in Supabase with row-level security.
