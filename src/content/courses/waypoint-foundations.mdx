## What you'll ship

- A Waypoint-branded LMS shell deployed to Vercel.
- Supabase auth configured with email magic links and optional passwords.
- Storage buckets for course media (`course-media`) and learner submissions (`submissions`).
- Markdown/MDX course content synced from GitHub with PR-based QA.

## Outline

1. Establish the Waypoint design system (tokens, gradients, buttons, and navigation).
2. Build GitHub-centered content flows with MDX and preview deployments.
3. Wire Supabase auth, RLS-ready Postgres tables, and storage buckets.
4. Add learner progress, check-ins, and quiz scaffolding with API routes and server actions.
5. Ship automated CI gates to lint MDX, run tests, and protect main branches.

## Supabase setup checklist

- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` configured in Vercel.
- Buckets: `course-media`, `submissions`, and optionally `avatars`.
- RLS policies enabled for course progress tables and submissions.
- SMTP provider configured in Supabase for production-ready email.
