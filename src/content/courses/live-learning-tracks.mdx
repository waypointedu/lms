## Cohort workflow

- Pre-build live session agendas with facilitator notes and time boxes.
- Track attendance and check-ins with Supabase server actions and API routes.
- Store recordings, slides, and breakout assets in the `course-media` bucket.
- Capture submissions in `submissions` with per-learner folders.

## What you need configured

- Supabase service role key stored server-side for write operations.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for client hydration.
- Slack/Discord webhook (optional) for real-time cohort alerts.

## Deliverables

- Weekly live session plan with GitHub issue templates.
- Automated reminders and recap posts that link to stored media.
- Cohort dashboard showing attendance, quiz completions, and submissions.
